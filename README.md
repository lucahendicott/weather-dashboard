# Weather Dashboard
A simple weather dashboard application that displays current day weather info and a 5 day forecast for any city the user searches for.

## Under the Hood
This apps directory includes an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file. The HTML includes some basic div elements, a search input and button. 

JavaScript is whats powering this app, using calls fetch info from Open Weather API. It uses 3 API's. One to fetch the current days weather info, one for a 5 day forecast and one for the current day UV index. Within in the current days api request I added the proper items within the API using innerHTML to display the content through the HTML.
