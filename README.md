# Weather Dashboard
A simple weather dashboard application that displays current day weather info and a 5 day forecast for any city the user searches for.

## Under the Hood
This apps directory includes an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file. The HTML includes some basic div elements, a search input and button. 

JavaScript is whats mainly powering this app, using API calls to fetch info from Open Weather API. It uses 3 API's. One to fetch the current days weather info, one for a 5 day forecast and one for the current day UV index. Within in the current days api request, added the proper items within the API using innerHTML to display the content through the HTML.
